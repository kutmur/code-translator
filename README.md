# CodeTranslator 🔁

**CodeTranslator** is a VS Code extension that automatically translates pasted code into the language of the currently open file.  
It detects the source language, uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) based translation, and provides inline AI-powered suggestions.

## 💡 Features (Planned)

- Detect pasted code's language
- Automatically translate code to target language (based on active file)
- Show inline suggestion (ghost text) in VS Code
- Accept translation with a Tab press
- Use AI + AST-based transformation logic for accuracy

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- TypeScript (VS Code extension API)
- Tree-sitter / AST parsers
- Claude/OpenAI for fallback translation
- WASM tools (optional for performance)
